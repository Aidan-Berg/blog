        "Hello! I am Aidan Berg *(he/him)*, an epidemiologist working as a research data specialist at the University of Illinois School of Social Work. Currently, much of my work focuses on independent evaluation of Illinois Medicaid 1115 Behavioral Health Transformation Demonstration Waiver. I have an affinity for data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization with a variety of software packages, primarily R. When I am not working on data analysis, I am usually writing: grant reports, policy evaluation, IRB requests, PHI data applications, and whatever other technical writing can move our projects at UIUC's Center for Prevention Research and Development forward.\n",
